# Book-Manager
In the current period of my life, I started developing a huge interest about books and their powerfull lessons and connections.
So, since I do enjoy reading books and I was having a very hard time to organize them all, I have decide to use my programming skills in order to help me solve that problem.
And here it is my latest project, a Book Manager developed by me, in order just not to enhance my programming skills , but to help me in my daily life.

TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED:

PYTHON - My favorite and most familiar language, used for me to craft many projects, such as Chat Bots, Algorithyms and more.
With an easy syntax, it allows me to conduct the flow of the code in a much easy and fast way than any other language.

FLASK - The Microframework of Python, deeply used in companies and small projects.
Very easy to manipulate, it serves for me to adjust my frontend routes and make the connection between what the user sees and the backend structure.

SQLALCHEMY - The language used for DataBases, but in this project I used a Pythonic version of it. FlaskSqlAlchemy allows me to write code instead of
pure SQL code in order to create my DataBase, helping me track each book that I insert by it's id,title,genre and current status ( Finished or Not ), in
a way that it keep stored and I dont have to always write again.

THAT IS IT!
Hope that you guys really enjoyed this new project, feel free to share  your ideas and thoughts on how you would expand on this!
